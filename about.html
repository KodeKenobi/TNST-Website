                <h3>Message from the Executive Director</h3>
                <p>
                  In South Africa, the voices of struggling youth can be heard over battles because their socio-economic environment has not afforded them sufficient tools to match post-school realities relating to integration in higher education and the workforce. 
                  This pre-entry deficit is attributed to poor learner socialisation, and TNST’s answer is personal mastery, critical thinking and thought leadership at Senior FET phase in order to inspire desirable school-leaver attributes such as resourcefulness and adaptability. 
                  We believe that our mission in pioneering a supplementary educational project of critical thinking, and a place of discovery for personal mastery constructs aligns with the phenomenon of Africa Rising where young South Africans should be prepared to harness all the opportunities available to them in the wake of the 4th Industrial Revolution and beyond.
                  The solution that TNST has is not for a single race or a single class, however it is really two things. It’s a social fit and it’s an African solution.

                <span>TNST is founded on the growing need</span>
								to equip school leavers with critical thinking and personal mastery tools which are necessary for them to
								effectively function with a heightened awareness of self and the realities of the world they live in. As they’re
								being brought into the mainstream of the economy, TNST delegates will be well poised to assume a position of
								positive impact in society as our commitment to Africa Rising. TNST will achieve this simply by creating advantage
								for our delegates with a platform where they can help themselves, each other and create meaningful connections as
								they adapt for the future and the promise it holds. Our approach democratises the consumption experience of
								education and recognises that our delegates have a mind which is an extension of just the brain, and our
								facilitators as industry players will connect experiences with the unique curriculum using a socratic method of
								delivery modelled on dialogue and interaction. Our programme delivery is rooted in independent judgment, enquiry
								and thinking. TNST will partner with its delegates and beneficiaries and will bear the torch in exploring the multiple
								stories of the world that we live in by acknowledging that our worldviews are not untrue, but rather an incomplete
								reality. TNST will strive for all its ideals and give value to the Humanities, soft skills and the human mind in the
								emergence of Africa Rising and the rise of the 4th industrial revolution and beyond.

								relevance. As a leading African institution that is attuned to the skills needed for young
								people to succeed in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, TNST is built on principles of
								stimulating critical thought and sense making. We are committed to providing quality
								platforms of knowledge testing, necessary alternative education and an evolving curriculum,
								founded on an ever-changing world, cutting edge research and facilitation, public engagement
								and productive partnerships with brand-aligned institutions that speak to TNST’s social purpose,
								and which provide corporate social opportunity in achieving its mission.</p>
